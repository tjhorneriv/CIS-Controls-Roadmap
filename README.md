CIS Controls Roadmap for IG1 Enterprise

This project will demonstrate how to use the CIS Controls Guide to protect an IG1 level enterprise from cybersecurity threats. An IG1 enterprise is small to medium-sized with limited IT and cybersecurity expertise to dedicate towards protecting IT assets and personnel. The principal concern of these enterprises is to keep the business operational, as they have a limited tolerance for downtime. The sensitivity of the data that they are trying to protect is low and mainly surrounds employee and financial information.

Safeguards selected for IG1 should be implementable with limited cybersecurity expertise and aimed to thwart general, non-targeted attacks. These safeguards will also typically be designed to work in conjunction with small or home office commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software. 

In this project I will be using the most up-to-date CIS Controls (Version 8) to provide an example walkthrough for a fictional IG1 sized company which I will refer to as Albatross Insurance or simply Albatross. I will be approximating the technology that a business this size would have in use. The process would obviously be more thorough with more safeguards for an IG2 or IG3 level company that has greater security needs.  

For the sake of brevity, the assets and operational capacity of this fictional company will be much smaller than a typical IG1 company therefore each safeguard will have less complexity than a typical IG1 enterprise would. This is meant more as an exercise to show how you would approach implementing the safeguards when evaluating a business under the CIS Controls.

Albatross will only have two employees named Dick and Jane Garfunkel. They are old school and only use technology when absolutely necessary to complete their jobs. I was hired to give them a secure baseline that can be maintained and easily expanded as their business grows. I will also be in charge of their incident response should a breach occur. I hope you enjoy!
